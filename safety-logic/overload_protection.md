# Overload Protection Module

## Purpose
The Overload Guard module protects the system from electrical and load-related damage by continuously monitoring current levels and disconnecting the load when unsafe conditions are detected.

## Responsibilities
- Monitor current or load values
- Detect overload conditions based on predefined thresholds
- Immediately shut down the relay to prevent damage
- Notify the recovery system for further action

## Working Principle
When the measured current exceeds the safe threshold, the Overload Guard triggers an emergency shutdown. The system remains in a protected state until recovery logic restores normal operation.

## Key Advantage
This module ensures hardware safety, improves system reliability, and prevents permanent damage during abnormal operating conditions.
